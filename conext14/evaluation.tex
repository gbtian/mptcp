\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we implemented our multipath IP in Linux kernel $3.12.1$ under Ubuntu system and install the prototype on two desktops. Both desktops are connected directly to one router without any middle-box. Each desktop has two $100Mbps$ NICs which means that there are totally $4$ paths and the capacity is $200MBps$ between the two nodes. We use Netem tool in Linux to throttle the connection to evaluate our prototype under multiple scenarios. Wireless connection is also considered in our evaluation.

In all experiments, we try to keep the configuration of each node unchanged after installation. We don't do any special configuration to the system, neither we do any optimization to squeeze out all possible throughput. Except specific experiments that can only be applied to MPIP like UDP experiment and customization MPIP routing, we try to do side-by-side comparison with MPTCP for TCP connections. We will figure out how these two features work independently and together as stated in Section~\ref{sec:together};

For all throughput related experiments, we use iperf3 to generate traffic between the client to the server.


\subsection{Clock Offset}
\label{sec:clock}

During our experiments, we found that the clock of each node has some small difference. In our experiment configuration, the clock of the server is slightly faster than the client. Even this error is very small, we still see the difference in a long experiment.
Certainly, nowadays, most computers have NTP enabled and the system's local time synchronize with time server periodically, but we still think that this difference is worth to be shown here.

On our experiment plat, we turn off NTP on both nodes, do a TCP transmission with iperf3 for one day with consistent traffic. Inside MPIP, we record the one-way delay of each packet from the client to server. Because the traffic load is consistent, queuing delay roughly remains the same. But as shown in Figure~\ref{fig.clock}, because of the clock offset between the two nodes, the trend of queuing delay exposes an linearly increasing curve even the trend is very slow. In Figure~\ref{fig.clock}, we record the queuing delay every one minute. For the whole day($1400$ minutes), we can see that the clock offset is about $350$ milliseconds which means that the server's clock runs one millisecond fast than the client for each four minutes. We will be able to see this trend again in following results.

\subsection{TCP Evaluation}
\label{sec:tcp}

As the dominating traffic, TCP plays a critical role in today's Internet. We try to evaluate the performance of MPIP over TCP connections in multiple network configurations. 

\subsubsection{TCP Out-of-order Process}
\label{sec:outoforder}

In Section~\ref{sec:outoforder}, we explained why out-of-order is a problem that must be dealt with in multipath implementations, and we also proposed our solution to this problem. To verify our proposition, we replace one NIC card on the client with a wireless interface. In our experiment plat, the RTT of one path with two wired NICs is about $0.1$ms while paths with one the wireless NIC is about $0.5$ms which will generate enough out-of-order packets. Also, to make sure that there are heavy load of packets to be assigned to the wireless NIC card, instead of using the standard path selection algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:selection}, we fix the weight of all the four paths to be the same. Then we make sure that $50\%$ of outbound packets will be assigned to the wireless NIC.
With this configuration, we do a regular TCP transmission that lasts for $20$ minutes with out-of-order process enabled and disabled respectively. The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.outoforder}.

With the same configuration, Figure~\ref{fig.outoforder} shows the improvement brought by the out-of-order process. The average throughput is $XX$Mbps and $XX$Mbps with/out out-of-order process respectively. The improvement maybe trivial if the delay on all the paths is the same because most packets will arrive at the receiver in the order of being sent out. But for multipath connections, it can be very often that each path goes through a totally different route, that is where out-of-order happens most. In all following experiments, we enable out-of-order process by default.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Addition/Removal of Path}
\label{sec:switch}

In Figure~\ref{fig.switch}, a $6$ minutes experiment is done for MPIP and MPTCP respectively. The experiment consists of three stages. We start the experiment with $4$ paths fully functional. After two minutes, we unplug the wire of one NIC at the client to reduce the number of path to $2$. The wire is plugged back for the last two minutes to add back the number of path to $4$.

In both case, MPIP and MPTCP adapt to the change smoothly. The transmission of iperf3 doesn't pause except the change of throughput. Because of the overhead to close and open new TCP connections, when IP address changes happen, MPTCP has longer delay than MPIP, especially when adding paths.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{TCP Throughput Enhancement}
\label{sec:tcptp}

As we mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:tcp}, there are two different implementation of multipath TCP in our system to solve NAT problem which are fake TCP connection and UDP wrapper. We do a specific experiment to evaluate the performance of each approach. With a $20$ minutes TCP transmission for each, the average throughput for fake TCP and UDP wrapper is $165.4$Mbps and $164.7$Mbps respectively while we get an average throughput of $92.7$Mbps for regular TCP. This result shows that both implementations have roughly the same performance. In all following experiments, we use fake TCP by default, but UDP is still kept as an option for users.


Now we start to do side-by-side comparison between MPIP and MPTCP for TCP traffic. Figure~\ref{fig.tp_bar} shows the average throughput comparison results for multiple configurations. 

We first do the transmission without any throttles which means the capacity of the connection is $200$Mbps. We can see that MPIP achieves the highest throughput which is $171$Mbps, MPTCP only gets $129.5$Mbps. When we combine MPIP and MPTCP together as stated in Section~\ref{sec:together}, we get a throughput of $164.6$Mbps.

%\textbf{NIC BW Limit}. When we limit the outbound bandwidth of one NIC card on the client to $40$Mbps, we get the result of the second bar group in Figure~\ref{fig.tp_bar}. In this scenario, the capacity of the connection is $140$Mbps, MPIP and MPTCP get roughly the same throughput, but when they work together, the highest throughput is achieved.

By limiting the bandwidth from one NIC of the client to the two NICs on the server to $20$Mbps, we create a connection with capacity of $140$Mbps. MPIP gets the lowest bandwidth here followed by MPTCP, but when they work together, the highest throughput is achieved.

In our experiment plat, with wired connection, the round trip time is trivial(about $0.1$ms). To emulate a connection with more delay, we manually add $5$ms delay to each NIC on the client and get result of the fourth bar group in Figure~\ref{fig.tp_bar}. The result is roughly the same as without limit.

By replacing one NIC on the client to a wireless interface, we evaluate the performance of MPIP under wireless connection. In this case, MPTCP achieves higher throughput than MPIP, but still, when they work together, the highest throughput is achieved.

In Figure~\ref{fig.path_tp_bar}, we do a analysis among different paths for MPIP transmission to clarify how all packets are assigned to each path. 

From the throughput comparison results, we can see that even the characters of a path is almost the same, because the coupling of different paths, there can be huge difference in their throughput. In our experiment set-up, in the case of no limit and adding delay, all four paths literally have the same characters, but results show that most traffic is taken by two paths. This happens because the four paths are not independent while one NIC is shared by two paths. The queuing delay generated by one path may also affect the queuing delay on the other path. In Figure~\ref{fig.mpip_path}, we take the unlimited connection as an example to show the trend of throughput and queuing delay for each path. The four paths share the traffic equally at first, but as coupling among them takes effect, the proportion becomes diverged, and finally two out of the four paths take most traffic of the session.
The same explanation can be applied to other throughput comparison results. When limiting bandwidth, we can see that the two limited paths($1$ and $2$) don't use all their bandwidth, neither the unlimited two paths($3$ and $4$), this results in the low throughput for MPIP in this scenario shown in Figure~\ref{fig.tp_bar}. When wireless is applied to the connection, the two paths that contains the wireless interface almost get nothing assigned. This is because the high queuing delay of these two paths.

Figure~\ref{fig.nolimitqdcomp} shows the queuing delay information trend. Because of the clock offset issue we mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:clock}, we see an increasing trend in all results. According to calculation, the amount of offset during the whole experiment is consistent with the result shown in Figure~\ref{fig.clock}. Generally the queuing delay of wired connection keeps stable once the TCP transmission except wireless. 

%In Figure~\ref{fig.delayqdcomp}, we manually add $5$ms delay to each NIC, and also get large but systematic fluctuation, this is cause by Netem tool that is used to add the delay.

For paths that have wireless interface, the fluctuation is very large. Besides their average value is almost two times of wired connection, their variation is even larger as shown in Table~\ref{tb.wireless}. In Figure~\ref{fig.path_tp_bar}, we can see that the two wireless paths get little traffic because the large queuing delay values results very small value of path weight.

%Besides using all four paths, we also limit the number of paths to two by properly configuring MPIP. We limit the bandwidth of one path to $40$Mbps which makes the capacity $140$Mbps on the connection. Figure~\ref{fig.twopathstpcomp} and Figure~\ref{fig.twopathsqdcomp} shows the throughput and queuing delay result for this configuration. The result we get here is roughly the same as when we limit the bandwidth for full mesh.

%\end{figure}

Besides the controlled lab experiments, we also evaluate MPIP on the Internet to verify the prototype's NAT immunization and system robustness. We set up our server at Emulab\cite{emulab} which is located in Utah while the client is in New York. Because there is only one NIC that connects to Internet on the Emulab node, there are only $2$ paths in this case. 

With this configuration, we do three experiments for different bottleneck placement. First, we connect both NICs to the same router that connects to Optimum Cable with $15$Mbps bandwidth. In this case, both NICs share the same bottleneck, we don't expect any throughput enhancement at all. Secondly, we connect one NIC to Optimum and connect the other NIC to Verizon FIOS with $25$Mbps bandwidth. Finally, we connect one NIC to Optimum and connect the other wireless NIC to TMobile $4$G network through an iPhone 6 plus's hotspot. In the latter two cases, each NIC has different bottleneck, and potential throughput enhance is expected. According to our test, the capacity between our client and the server in Emulab is about $5$Mbps for Optimum, $10$Mbps for FIOS and $900$Kbps for TMobile $4$G. The result of iperf3 TCP transmission result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.emulab_tp_bar} and Figure~\ref{fig.emulab_tp_bar}.

When sharing bottleneck, all three sessions fully use the capacity of the connection with little difference. The two paths don't share the traffic equally either because of coupling between them. When Optimum and FIOS are used, overall, MPTCP gets the lowest throughput among the three sessions followed by MPIP. Still, when MPIP and MPTCP combine, the highest throughput is achieved. As for the assignment of packets for the two paths in MPIP, P$1$ in Figure~\ref{fig.emulab_tp_bar} is the path for Optimum and P$2$ is for FIOS. Approximately the traffic is assigned to each path according to the capacity of each link. This proves that the delay-based path selection algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:delay} also works perfectly in real Internet. 

The result for $4$G connection is slightly different. In this case, MPTCP gets the highest throughput, the other two sessions get roughly this same throughput which is lower than MPTCP. According to our observation, comparing to Optimum and FIOS, the delay of $4$G connection is very unstable, this causes very high queuing delay. According to the delay-based path selection algorithm, for most of time, the weight of the $4$G path is very small. This can be shown in the traffic assignment for the $4$G path in Figure~\ref{fig.emulab_patp_bar}. When MPIP and MPTCP work together, both TCP sessions have two paths at IP level, neither makes good use of the $4$G path because of the unstable delay.

\subsection{UDP and Customization Routing}
\label{sec:udp}

In this section we try to evaluate the usage of UDP and customization routing in our MPIP system. We won't include any throughput enhancement here because the result is straightforward that we get nearly double throughput by applying multipath for UDP traffic in our experiment plat. Instead, we use Skype\cite{skype} as an experiment application to show how UDP works in our system. Meantime, we will show how our customization routing mechanism help improve Skype audio call quality and TCP throughput.

Skype uses direct connection for two parties calls. All the video and audio packets are transmitted between two ends of the call directly through UDP protocol. Comparing to video streaming, Skype calls generally have higher requirement on the responsiveness of audio packets. According to our experiments, almost all Skype audio packets are less than $200$ bytes while video packets are generally larger than $1000$ bytes. To make optimization to audio packets, we add one entry to Table~\ref{tb.route}. For packets that is smaller than $200$ bytes, responsiveness consideration will be the first priority. Besides a Skype audio call, we also run an iperf3 TCP session between the two nodes.

For this experiment, we only use one NIC on the server while on the client we still have two NICs working. For path $1$, we set the bandwidth to $2$Mbps and the delay to $50$ms. For path $2$, we set the bandwidth to $300$Kbps and the delay to $20$ms. Then we have one high bandwidth-delay product path and one low bandwidth-delay product path. By enabling and disabling customization routing, we get the result in Figure~\ref{fig.skype}. Figure~\ref{fig.skypetpcomp} shows the throughput of iperf3 TCP connection with/out customization, Figure~\ref{fig.skypedelaycomp} shows Skype's audio round trip time during the whole experiment with/out customization. This round trip time information is extracted from Skype's own real-time technical report, it shows the amount of delay the user experience during the audio call. 

From Figure~\ref{fig.skypedelaycomp}, we see the huge reduction of audio delay. The average RTT is $82$ms and $119$ ms with/out routing optimization. Because with queuing delay based algorithm, most Skype audio packet with be assigned to path $1$ because of its high bandwidth, but the by-product is higher delay. By assigning audio packets to path $2$, a much better audio call quality can be achieved. From Figure~\ref{fig.skypetpcomp}, we see that we get roughly the same throughput in both case, but the result with customization routing enabled is more consistent. This is because with customization routing enabled, path $2$ has its designated traffic. Because of its low bandwidth, the queuing delay accumulates, then the TCP traffic from the iperf3 session will probably only be assigned to path $1$ and results in a more consistent throughput.

\caption{UDP and Customized Routing with Skype and ACK Optimization}
\label{fig.skype}
\end{figure*}


In Figure~\ref{fig.routingack}, by applying customization routing, we prove that this mechanism can improve TCP throughput also. TCP ACK packets are generally very small. If these packets are assigned to a high delay path, probably, TCP congestion control will be trigger and pull down the overall performance of TCP. 

We make the configuration same as the one for Figure~\ref{fig.outoforder} by replacing one wired NIC with wireless NIC, and also, fix all the path weight to the same value to generate substantial TCP congestion control because of ACK packets' assignment. In Figure~\ref{fig.routingack}, we do the same TCP transmission by enabling and disabling customization routing for small packet as in Skype. We can see obvious throughput enhancement in Figure~\ref{fig.routingack}. By calculating, the average throughput of the two cases are $24.2$Mbps and $28.5$Mbps.

As we mentioned, this customization routing only considers packet length as the metric. Potential future work can be done based on this framework. Unlike MPTCP where each path is a regular TCP connection, in MPIP, we manage all the paths in a highly autonomous way, this provides good flexibility to do more customization.

%\subsection{Smooth connection switch}
%\label{sec:switch}
%
%In Figure~\ref{fig.switch}, we verify that smooth switch between different NIC cards works perfectly over our MPIP implementation by doing an IPERF TCP experiment. We do a side-by-side comparison between MPIP and MPTCP. We also divide the experiment into $3$ sections with $120$ seconds for each section. On the client side of the connection, there are two NIC cards. In the first $120$ seconds, both NIC cards work synchronously, then we disable one of them for $120$ seconds, and during the last $120$ seconds, we enable back the NIC card. The result shows that our MPIP system can follow this on/off process perfectly with stable throughput. For MPTCP, as shown in previous experiments, MPTCP has higher fluctuation than MPIP even MPTCP can achieve higher throughput than MPIP. This happens because in MPTCP, there are more than one TCP connections ($4$ in this experiment), and each connection has its own congestion window. Although congestion control in MPTCP is coupled among different connections, fluctuation have more chances to happen with $4$ relatively independent congestion windows. But in MPIP, one one TCP connection is constructed for each session which means that there is only one congestion windows. In this case, the throughput is more consistent than that of MPTCP.
